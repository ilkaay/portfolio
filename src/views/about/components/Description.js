      I am a 4th-grade computer engineering student at Eski≈üehir Osmangazi
      University.
      <br /> <br />
      I am passionate about software development and designing websites. I
      taught myself about front-end development because of that passion. I
      learned HTML, CSS, JS and after that, I learned VUE, React, Angular,
      Typescript and GraphQL to develop more professional apps. I am still
      teaching myself about front-end engineering and currently, I practice with
      the technologies I have learned.
      <br /> <br />I am looking for new things to learn, to be a better
      engineer.
